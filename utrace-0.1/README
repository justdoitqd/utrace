ltrace has been developed mainly by Juan Cespedes <cespedes@debian.org>,
but he has received many contributions from other people.  The following
people have contributed significantly to this project:

* Pat Beirne <pbeirne@home.com> (ARM port)
* Roman Hodek <Roman.Hodek@informatik.uni-erlangen.de> (m68k port)
* Morten Eriksen <mortene@sim.no> (misc fixes)
* Silvio Cesare <silvio@big.net.au> (ELF hacking)
* Timothy Fesig <slate@us.ibm.com> (S390 port)
* Anton Blanchard <anton@samba.org> (Powerpc port)

* Jakub Bogusz <qboosh@pld-linux.org> (alpha port)
* SuSE (amd64 port)

1. Introduction
---------------
ltrace is a debugging tool, similar to strace, but it traces library
calls instead of system calls.

2. Where can I find it
----------------------
At the moment, it's only available as a Debian package.  Please let
me know if you distribute it any other way.

You may find it at:
 * ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/l/ltrace/

Alternatively, you may find it in any Debian mirror.  For more info,
see ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/README.mirrors

3. How does it work
-------------------
Using software breakpoints, just like gdb.

4. Where does it work
---------------------
At the time of writting, it works only with ELF32 executables. It only
works in Linux, and it only works on some architectures (i386, m68k,
S/390, ARM, PowerPC, amd64, SPARC and alpha processors).

It is part of at least Debian GNU/Linux, RedHat, SuSE and Mandrake.

5. Bugs
-------
Too many to list here :).  If you like to submit a bug report, or a
feature request, either do that against the Debian `ltrace' package,
or mail ``Juan Cespedes <cespedes@debian.org>''.

This file is very incomplete and out-of-date.
